# EMMA SimBot: Experience Hub

## Installing the repo

Like other repos in EMMA, we advocate for pyenv and Poetry for managing the project. To get setup with this repository, just run the following:

```bash
pyenv install
poetry env use $(pyenv which python)
poetry install
poetry shell
```

## How to do things with the CLI

There are more commands than mentioned here. For more details regarding _any command_, just add `--help`!

## How to update the service registry for SimBot

To change the models that are being used, update the file within `storage/registry/simbot/`

For example, to change the models being used in production, update `storage/registry/models/production.yml`. This change will propagate to all future actions.

## What if I need `sudo` with Docker?

If you need `sudo` to run Docker, you need to also use the `-E` flag â€” i.e., use `sudo -E` to run the commands.

If it can't find the python path to the venv used for this installation, you can get the executable path from `which python` and then export it into a new variable.

Assuming you've already installed and activated the virtualenv as above, you can run the following:

```bash
export LOCAL_PYTHON=$(which python)
sudo -E $LOCAL_PYTHON -m emma_experience_hub
```
